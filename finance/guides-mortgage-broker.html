<h1>Why Use a Mortgage Broker</h1>

<p>Well, it's quite simple really - why wouldn't you when: </p>


<h2>1. We're free </h2>
<p>Yes, we are free for you - our fee is paid by the lenders . 
</p>

<h2>2. We will give you back your time and peace of mind </h2>
<p>Getting a home loan doesn't have to be traumatic - we will do the research for you, deal with the banks on your behalf and provide assistance in completing the paperwork. </p>

<h2>3. We'll always be there to talk to you </h2>
<p>Sick of never getting a response? With us, your broker will be there for you at all times; will provide you with frequent communications and feedback and will be available for advice even after your loan has been settled - indeed, whenever you want to have a chat about your loan or financial circumstances. </p>

<h2>4. We take the time to understand your situation and recommend you the best course of action </h2> 
<p>Our consultant will work with you to better understand your circumstances, will make recommendations about how to maximize your borrowing power and will help you choose the loan that best fits you. </p>


<h2>5. We will come to meet you wherever you want, whenever you want</h2> 
<P>At work, at home or at the cafe around the corner - we'll meet you wherever it's easier for you. Unlike a bank, we are not working from 9 to 5: we can meet you outside of working hours, or on the weekend. 
</P>
<h2>6. We offer you a wider choice of home loans than the banks </h2>
<p>We have access to approximately 500 loans from more than  40 lenders, as opposed to being limited to a bank's restrictive range of home loan products. </p>
<h2>7. We will match the existent loans to your needs and circumstances </h2>
<p>Our proprietary software matches up your situation and needs to all the loans in our database; then our consultants review them and find you the loan that is best for YOU. </p>

<h2>8. We know everything there is to know about home loans - it's our job </h2>
<p>
All our consultants are full members of the Mortgage & Finance Association of Australia and also hold a Diploma of Financial Services (Finance / Mortgage Broking Management). They undertake continuous industry training and accreditations with panel bank and non-bank lenders. They know their loan products and all about the fine print. </p>
<p>
So if you are ready to take the next step and find the home loan that is best for you - click the button and let us do the rest! 
 </p>
 <p>
You can read more about our code of conduct in our customer charter. </p>
