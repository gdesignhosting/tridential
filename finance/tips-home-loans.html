<h2>Add up those home loan fees<a name="1" id="1"></a></h2>
<p>The Daily Telegraph, 12/03/2002, page 32.
Once you've saved up the deposit for a home, don't forget to take into account all the extra fees that come with buying a house - some or all of these: stamp duty, legal costs, disbursements, mortgage insurance, pest inspection report, survey report, builder's report, strata inspection report, loan application fee, valuation fee, registration fee, sundry fees like refinancing or switching fees.</p>
<p>
On a mortgage loan of $300,000, expect to pay at least $15,000 in fees. With mortgage insurance, this will rise to about $17,470.
</p>
  

<h2>Additional repayments
  <a name="2" id="2"></a></h2>
<p>
Making additional repayments beyond what's required in your minimum monthly repayment is one of the best ways to reduce the total interest paid and term of your loan.
</p><p>
As a rule of thumb, every $1 in extra repayments you make early in the life of your loan saves around $2 in interest over the term of the loan, depending on the level of interest rates.
Consider either one-off lump sum payments when you have spare cash or commit to increasing your regular repayment amount.
</p><p>
However, make sure that your loan allows you to make additional repayments without penalty. Fixed-rate and basic (or 'no-frills' loans) often have restrictions on extra repayments or charge a fee for the privilege.
   </p>

<h2>Beware fixed rates<a name="3" id="3"></a></h2>

<p>
Attractive when interest rates are rising, fixed-rate loans also lock you in for a fixed term and as such are less flexible than variable-rate loans. You may not be able to make additional repayments or pay the loan out early without facing high penalty charges.
</p><p>
Fixed rate loans suit borrowers who really value the certainty of knowing exactly what their future repayments will be – property investors and borrowers on a tight budget, for example.
</p><p>
Borrowers trying to beat rate rises by picking the right time to lock in to a fixed rate are playing a risky game. Such borrowers are taking a gamble on the future and the longer the period you fix, the more of a gamble it is. Predicting interest rates three to fives years into the future is something akin to picking Lotto numbers.
</p>
   
<h2>
Check if there are ongoing fees
  <a name="4" id="4"></a></h2>
<p>
Many banks now charge monthly or annual administration fees on home loans. When comparing the cost of different loans, don't just look at the interest rate, look at the 'total cost of borrowing'.
</p>
<p>
Many lenders are using 'average annual percentage rates' (AAPRs) as a means of comparing the true or total cost of loans. Although this measure incorporates fees as well as the interest rate, they can be misleading because an AAPR will vary on a particular loan depending on the amount borrowed.
</p>
   

<h2>Choosing the right home loan<a name="5" id="5"></a></h2>

<p>
The Daily Telegraph, 12/03/2002, page 32.<br />
There are no right or wrong answers when it comes to choosing a home loan - it just has to be right for you. But you must know what all the options are before making a decision. A basic fact to keep in mind is that the more flexible the loan, the higher interest you'll pay. A variable loan which allows you to draw against repayments or offset savings against the mortgage will have a higher rate than a basic loan.
</p><p>
Always compare loans with the same features when looking for the best interest rate. Shop around. And if you're earning more than about $50,000 a year, or $80,000 with a partner, ask about professional loan packages. A professional loan interest rate is usually half a per cent lower than the standard.
</p>
 
<h2>
Consider a portable loan<a name="6" id="6"></a></h2>
<p>
A portable home loan allows you to sell one property and move to a new one without having to refinance, ie. pay out the old loan and take out a new one. This saves application and legal fees.
</p><p>
Most lenders will insist that the loan amount required for the new property is no greater than the existing amount borrowed.
</p>
  
<h2>
Do you need a redraw facility?
  <a name="7" id="7"></a></h2>
<p>
A redraw facility allows you to make additional repayments on your mortgage, and then have access to the additional repayments if you need to.</p>
<p>
However, the facility is normally only available on "Standard Variable" loans, which are more expensive than basic variable loans. Before you choose the more expensive loan, make sure you understand the conditions attached to the redraw facility as it may include a minimum amount and a fee every time you use it.
</p>
   
<h2>
Do your homework
  <a name="8" id="8"></a></h2>
<p>
There are so many home loans on the market these days with an increasing variety of rates, fees and features that it really pays to shop around. Somewhere there is a loan that best suits your circumstances.
</p><p>
Our home loan selector is designed to make comparing what's on offer much easier.
</p>
  
<h2>
Keep accurate records
  <a name="9" id="9"></a></h2>
<p>
Keep accurate records of your deposits and ATM transactions. It is also wise to keep copies of your loan application and approval documents in a safe place.
</p><p>
This is the best way to avoid hefty fees which may be charged by a bank when its customers want to see copies of their cheques or loan files.
</p>
 
<h2>
Look beyond the banks
  <a name="10" id="10"></a></h2>

<p>
Get a feel for what's on offer credit unions, building societies, mortgage originators, community banks, boutique online or telephone banks may offer better interest rates than the big banks because they are anxious to win new business or they are non-profit organisations.
</p>
 
<h2>
Look for flexibility
  <a name="11" id="11"></a></h2>

<p>
When taking out a loan make sure it offers the flexibility to meet the changing circumstances you will undoubtedly experience over the 10 to 25 years of your loan. The ability to make extra repayments, redraw extra repayments, fix the rate on a portion of the loan, or refinance to another loan if need be are all features to be considered.
</p><p>
Most fixed term and rate loans and some basic loans don't allow you to make additional repayments, or charge a penalty for doing so. Make sure you understand the terms and conditions before taking out your loan.
</p>
  
<h2>
Make the most of rate falls
  <a name="12" id="12"></a></h2>
<p>
If monthly repayments drop because interest rates have fallen, try to maintain the old repayment levels. This means you will pay off more of the principal with each repayment, reduce the term of your loan and the total amount of interest paid.
</p>
 
<h2>
Make your surplus cash work harder
  <a name="13" id="13"></a></h2>

<p>
Use cash savings to help pay off your loan quicker. Remember the old saying 'a dollar saved is a dollar earned'? If you have a home loan at 7 per cent, every extra dollar you pay off the principal is another dollar you are not paying 7 per cent on each year. If you instead put that extra dollar into a savings account you are only going to earn 2 or 3, perhaps 5 per cent at the most. Therefore putting savings into your loan earns you twice as much as a savings account.
</p><p>
These days, redraw facilities available on most standard variable loans allow you to take back those extra payments if needed anyway. See also ‘Offset accounts and all-in-one loans’ below.
</p>
  
<h2>
Offset accounts and all-in-one loans
  <a name="14" id="14"></a></h2>
<p>
Borrowers can also make use of the increasing range of offset accounts and salary account or 'all-in-one' loans which offer the chance to make every spare dollar work to reduce your home loan. Savings in offset accounts are subtracted from the outstanding loan amount each month so interest is charged only the net amount. But make sure the interest rate on any offset account is the same as that on the home loan for a ‘full offset’.
</p>
<p>
All-in-one or salary account loans allow your income to be paid directly into the loan account to reduce the loan outstanding sooner than waiting for the repayment due date. You are also effectively making larger repayments because you only withdraw the money you need to live on each month, leaving all surplus cash in the loan account to reduce the balance. Borrowers must be disciplined, however, and not withdraw more money than is going in to ensure the loan is paid off over time.
</p>
  
<h2>
Pay your loan off quicker with fortnightly or weekly repayments
  <a name="15" id="15"></a></h2>

<p>
Converting your monthly repayment into two fortnightly or four weekly payments can reduce the term of your loan in two ways:
</p>

<ul class="standard">
  <li>because there are more than two fortnights or four weeks in every month, dividing your original monthly repayment into two or four means you actually pay more over the course of a calendar month.</li>
  <li>when interest is calculated daily, the more frequent repayments result in less interest being charged to your loan over the course of a month.</li>
  </ul>


 

  <h2> 

Use your home equity to borrow
  <a name="16" id="16"></a></h2>

<p>
The more you pay off your home loan, the more of the property you own or the more 'equity' in the property you build up. With a more flexible banking system these days, it is possible to borrow against this equity for further investment; a second property, shares etc. The advantage of borrowing against this equity rather than taking out a personal, investment or business loan is that the interest rate will invariably be lower – the better the asset you put up as collateral, the better the terms a lender will offer. Nothing beats bricks and mortar security (in this case, your home).</p>
